<h2>Project Overview</h2>

NFTs, as unique digital assets on the blockchain, have rapidly emerged as a prominent technology, with billions of dollars transacted annually. While the long-term future and regulatory landscape of NFTs remain uncertain, the inherent transparency of blockchain technology means all transactions are publicly recorded, providing a rich dataset for analysis.

This project delves into the sales history of CryptoPunks, where each record represents a distinct NFT sale, capturing details such as buyer and seller addresses, transaction prices in ETH and USD, sale dates and times, NFT IDs, transaction hashes, and NFT names.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

- <b>Data Analysis using SQL:</b> Proficiently querying and manipulating large datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- <b>Aggregation and Summary Functions:</b> Utilizing SQL's powerful aggregation capabilities (e.g., `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`) and window functions to summarize and analyze data effectively.
- <b>Date and Time Functions:</b> Extracting and analyzing trends based on various time granularities (e.g., daily, monthly, day of the week).
- <b>Data Transformation:</b> Creating new derived columns and manipulating existing data for enhanced analysis.
- <b>View Creation:</b> Defining logical views for simplified access to frequently used or derived datasets.
- <b>Subqueries and Joins:</b> Combining data from different perspectives to answer complex analytical questions.

<h2>Key Analyses Performed</h2>

This project addresses a series of analytical questions, including:
- Total number of sales within the specified period.
- Identification of the top 5 most expensive transactions by USD price.
- Calculation of a moving average of USD prices to observe price trends.
- Determination of average sale prices for each NFT name.
- Analysis of sales volume and average ETH price by day of the week.
- Construction of a descriptive summary for each transaction.
- Creation of a dedicated view for purchases made by a specific wallet address.
- Visualization preparation for ETH price ranges (histogram).
- Comparative analysis of highest and lowest sale prices for each NFT.
- Identification of the most sold NFT each month/year and its associated price.
- Calculation of total monthly sales volume.
- Counting transactions for a specific wallet.
- Development of an "estimated average value calculator" to account for outlier sales and provide a more representative daily average price.
